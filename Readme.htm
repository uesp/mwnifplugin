<P><BR>


<H3>Introduction<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="100%" SIZE="2"></H3>
NifPlugin is a 3DSMax v4.0 plugin which allows 3DS to load v3.0 NIF model files used in the ES:Morrowind
computer game. This utility is unofficial and not supported by Bethesda or Discreet in any manner.
<P>
It is important to note that this initial version is considered Beta and is far from finished. See the
features section below for what currently is and isn't supported.
<P>
For the latest release along with source code and documentation, see the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=90473"><B>MWEdit Files</B></A> area on
<A HREF="http:/www.sourceforge.net"><B>Source Forge</B></A>.

<H3>Installation<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="100%" SIZE="2"></H3>

To install the plugin, simply copy the <I>NIFPLUGIN.DLI</I> (merely a Windows DLL file renamed to DLI) into
your 3DSMax <I>PLUGINS</I> directory. If 3DSMax is currently running you can start the plugin manually by
choosing the <I>Customize-&gt;Plug-in Manager...</I> menu. If 3DSMax is not running it will find and load
the plugin automatically when it starts.
<P>
If you are updating the plugin from a previous version you will have to quit 3DSMax before you will be
allowed to overwrite the plugin file.
<P>
Once the plugin is installed you can then load NIF files from the <I>File-&gt;Import</I> menu.

<H3>Known Issues<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="100%" SIZE="2"></H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Smoothing groups are not properly implemented. The models should appear smoothed properly
			but you will notice that there is only one smoothing group assigned to each object.
			This may cause problems if you wish to modify the smoothing.

<DT><B>v0.11 Beta</B>
	<DD>Released 9 January 2004
		<UL>
		<LI>Materials are on by default in a shaded viewport (4 Jan 2004).
		<LI>Reduced the number of materials generated by reusing identical materials in a NIF file.
				The problem originates from the fact that some materials in a NIF file, although having
				the same name, are not identical. Thus, a simple material comparison must be done
				in order to determine whether two materials are the same or not (4 Jan 2004).
		<LI>Added support for RootCollisionNode record (5 Jan 2004).
